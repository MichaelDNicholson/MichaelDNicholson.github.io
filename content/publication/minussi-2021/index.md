abstract: Our knowledge of copy number evolution during the expansion of primary breast
  tumours is limited1,2. Here, to investigate this process, we developed a single-cell,
  single-molecule DNA-sequencing method and performed copy number analysis of 16,178 single
  cells from 8 human triple-negative breast cancers and 4 cell lines. The results
  show that breast tumours and cell lines comprise a large milieu of subclones (7–22)
  that are organized into a few (3–5) major superclones. Evolutionary analysis suggests
  that after clonal TP53 mutations, multiple loss-of-heterozygosity events and genome
  doubling, there was a period of transient genomic instability followed by ongoing
  copy number evolution during the primary tumour expansion. By subcloning single
  daughter cells in culture, we show that tumour cells rediversify their genomes and
  do not retain isogenic properties. These data show that triple-negative breast cancers
  continue to evolve chromosome aberrations and maintain a reservoir of subclonal
  diversity during primary tumour growth.
