abstract: 'Author summary How long does it take for a treatment naive, growing bacterial
  colony to be able to survive exposure to a cocktail of antibiotics? En route to
  multidrug resistance, what order did the drugs become impotent in? Questions such
  as these that pertain to the emergence of a significant cell type in a growing population
  arise frequently. They are often investigated via mathematical modelling but biologically
  insightful results are challenging to obtain. Here we outline a general framework
  of a stochastically growing population spreading through a graph to study such questions
  and provide simple formulas as answers. The significant cell type appears upon the
  population reaching a target vertex. Due to their simplicity, the derived formulas
  are widely accessible and can be used to guide and develop intuition on a range
  of biological scenarios. We demonstrate this on several settings including: how
  a region where drugs cannot penetrate affects the emergence of resistance, and,
  the ordering of mutations that leads to drugs being ineffective.'
