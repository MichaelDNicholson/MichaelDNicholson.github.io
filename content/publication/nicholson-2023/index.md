abstract: 'Author summary In settings such as bacterial infections and cancer, cellular
  populations grow exponentially. DNA mutations acquired during this growth can have
  profound effects, e.g. conferring drug resistance or faster tumour growth. In mathematical
  models of this fundamental process, considerable effort—spanning many decades—has
  been invested to understand the factors that control two key aspects of this process:
  how many cells exist with a set of mutations, and how long does it take for these
  cells to appear. In this paper, we consider these two aspects in a general mathematical
  framework. Surprisingly, for both quantities, we find universal probability distributions
  which are valid regardless of how many mutations we focus on, and what effect these
  mutations might have on the cells. The distributions are elegant and easy to work
  with, providing a computationally efficient alternative to intensive simulation-based
  approaches. We demonstrate the usefulness of our mathematical results by illustrating
  their consequences for bacterial experiments and cancer evolution.'
