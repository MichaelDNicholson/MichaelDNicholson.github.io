abstract: DNA base damage is a major source of oncogenic mutations1. Such damage can
  produce strand-phased mutation patterns and multiallelic variation through the process
  of lesion segregation2. Here, we exploited these properties to reveal how strand-asymmetric
  processes, such as replication and transcription, shape DNA damage and repair. Despite
  distinct mechanisms of leading and lagging strand replication3,4, we observe identical
  fidelity and damage tolerance for both strands. For small DNA adducts, our results
  support a model in which the same translesion polymerase is recruited on-the-fly
  to both replication strands, starkly contrasting the strand asymmetric tolerance
  of bulky adducts5. We find that DNA damage tolerance is also common during transcription,
  where RNA-polymerases frequently bypass lesions without triggering repair. At multiple
  genomic scales, we show the pattern of DNA damage induced mutations is largely shaped
  by the influence of DNA accessibility on repair efficiency, rather than gradients
  of DNA damage. Finally, we reveal specific genomic conditions that can corrupt the
  fidelity of nucleotide excision repair and actively drive oncogenic mutagenesis.
  These results provide insight into how strand-asymmetric mechanisms underlie the
  formation, tolerance, and repair of DNA damage, thereby shaping cancer genome evolution.Competing
