abstract = {Author summary How long does it take for a treatment naive, growing bacterial colony to be able to survive exposure to a cocktail of antibiotics? En route to multidrug resistance, what order did the drugs become impotent in? Questions such as these that pertain to the emergence of a significant cell type in a growing population arise frequently. They are often investigated via mathematical modelling but biologically insightful results are challenging to obtain. Here we outline a general framework of a stochastically growing population spreading through a graph to study such questions and provide simple formulas as answers. The significant cell type appears upon the population reaching a target vertex. Due to their simplicity, the derived formulas are widely accessible and can be used to guide and develop intuition on a range of biological scenarios. We demonstrate this on several settings including: how a region where drugs cannot penetrate affects the emergence of resistance, and, the ordering of mutations that leads to drugs being ineffective.},

abstract = {Author summary Understanding precisely how some bacteria survive exposure to antibiotics is a major research focus. Specific mutations in the bacterial genome are known to provide protection. However, it remains unclear how much time passes between a bacterium acquiring the genetic change and being able to tolerate antibiotics—termed the phenotypic delay—and what controls this delay. Here, using computer simulations and mathematical arguments we discuss three biologically plausible mechanisms of phenotypic delay. We investigate how each mechanism would affect the outcome of laboratory experiments often used to study the evolution of antibiotic resistance, and we highlight how the delay might be detected in such experiments. We also show that the existence of the delay could explain an observed discrepancy in the measurement of mutation rates, and demonstrate that one of our models provides a superior fit to experimental data. Our work exposes how molecular details at the intracellular level can have a direct effect on evolution at the population level.},

abstract = {Austria was an early hotspot of SARS-CoV-2 transmission due to winter tourism. By integrating viral genomic and phylogenetic analyses with time-resolved contact tracing data, Popa et al. examined the fine-scale dynamics of viral spread within and from Austria in the spring of 2020. Epidemiologically defined phylogenetic clusters and viral mutational profiles provided evidence of the ongoing fixation of two viral alleles within transmission chains and enabled estimation of the SARS-CoV-2 bottleneck size. This study provides an epidemiologically contextualized, high-resolution picture of SARS-CoV-2 mutational dynamics in an early international transmission hub.Superspreading events shaped the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and their rapid identification and containment are essential for disease control. Here, we provide a national-scale analysis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) superspreading during the first wave of infections in Austria, a country that played a major role in initial virus transmissions in Europe. Capitalizing on Austria's well-developed epidemiological surveillance system, we identified major SARS-CoV-2 clusters during the first wave of infections and performed deep whole-genome sequencing of more than 500 virus samples. Phylogenetic-epidemiological analysis enabled the reconstruction of superspreading events and charts a map of tourism-related viral spread originating from Austria in spring 2020. Moreover, we exploited epidemiologically well-defined clusters to quantify SARS-CoV-2 mutational dynamics, including the observation of low-frequency mutations that progressed to fixation within the infection chain. Time-resolved virus sequencing unveiled viral mutation dynamics within individuals with COVID-19, and epidemiologically validated infector-infectee pairs enabled us to determine an average transmission bottleneck size of 103 SARS-CoV-2 particles. In conclusion, this study illustrates the power of combining epidemiological analysis with deep viral genome sequencing to unravel the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to gain fundamental insights into mutational dynamics and transmission properties.},

@article{Minussi2021,
abstract = {Our knowledge of copy number evolution during the expansion of primary breast tumours is limited1,2. Here, to investigate this process, we developed a single-cell, single-molecule DNA-sequencing method and performed copy number analysis of 16,178 single cells from 8 human triple-negative breast cancers and 4 cell lines. The results show that breast tumours and cell lines comprise a large milieu of subclones (7–22) that are organized into a few (3–5) major superclones. Evolutionary analysis suggests that after clonal TP53 mutations, multiple loss-of-heterozygosity events and genome doubling, there was a period of transient genomic instability followed by ongoing copy number evolution during the primary tumour expansion. By subcloning single daughter cells in culture, we show that tumour cells rediversify their genomes and do not retain isogenic properties. These data show that triple-negative breast cancers continue to evolve chromosome aberrations and maintain a reservoir of subclonal diversity during primary tumour growth.},

@article{Kirkbride2021,
abstract = {Purpose Assess and compare the quality and diagnostic performance of CCTA between pre-liver and pre-kidney transplant patients, and gauge impact of CCTA on ICA requirements. Methods Patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD) were selected for CCTA if considered high-risk or after abnormal stress testing. All pre-liver and pre-kidney CCTAs between March 2018 and August 2020 were retrospectively included. CCTA quality was qualitatively graded as excellent/good/fair/poor, and CAD graded as < or ≥50% stenosis. Heart rate, coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores, and fractional flow reserve CT (FFRCT) results were collected. CAD stenosis was graded on invasive coronary angiogram (ICA) images, with ≥50% stenosis defined as significant. Results 162 pre-transplant patients (91 pre-liver, 71 pre-kidney). Pre-kidney patients had poorer CCTA quality (p = 0.04) and higher heart rate (median: 65 bpm vs 60 bpm, p < 0.001). Out of 147 diagnostic CCTAs (pre-liver: 84, pre-kidney: 63), 73 (49.7%) had a ≥50% stenosis (pre-liver: 38 (45.2%), pre-kidney:35 (55.6%)). 12/38 (31.6%) had a significantly reduced FFRCT, and 19/53 (35.8%) had ≥50% stenosis on ICA. Among patients whose CCTA was diagnostic and had ICA, stenosis severity was concordant in 10/23 (43.5%) pre-liver and 10/25 (40%) pre-kidney patients. All discordant cases had stenosis ‘over-called' on CCTA. Conclusion Diagnostic-quality CCTAs in high-risk pre-transplant patients are achievable and can greatly reduce ICA requirements by excluding significant CAD. CCTA quality is poorer in pre-kidney transplant patients compared to pre-liver, possibly due to higher heart rate.},

abstract = {The mutational landscape is shaped by many processes. Genic regions are vulnerable to mutation but are preferentially protected by transcription-coupled repair1. In microorganisms, transcription has been demonstrated to be mutagenic2,3; however, the impact of transcription-associated mutagenesis remains to be established in higher eukaryotes4. Here we show that ID4—a cancer insertion–deletion (indel) mutation signature of unknown aetiology5 characterized by short (2 to 5 base pair) deletions —is due to a transcription-associated mutagenesis process. We demonstrate that defective ribonucleotide excision repair in mammals is associated with the ID4 signature, with mutations occurring at a TNT sequence motif, implicating topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) activity at sites of genome-embedded ribonucleotides as a mechanistic basis. Such TOP1-mediated deletions occur somatically in cancer, and the ID-TOP1 signature is also found in physiological settings, contributing to genic de novo indel mutations in the germline. Thus, although topoisomerases protect against genome instability by relieving topological stress6, their activity may also be an important source of mutations in the human genome.},

@article{Anderson2022,
abstract = {DNA base damage is a major source of oncogenic mutations1. Such damage can produce strand-phased mutation patterns and multiallelic variation through the process of lesion segregation2. Here, we exploited these properties to reveal how strand-asymmetric processes, such as replication and transcription, shape DNA damage and repair. Despite distinct mechanisms of leading and lagging strand replication3,4, we observe identical fidelity and damage tolerance for both strands. For small DNA adducts, our results support a model in which the same translesion polymerase is recruited on-the-fly to both replication strands, starkly contrasting the strand asymmetric tolerance of bulky adducts5. We find that DNA damage tolerance is also common during transcription, where RNA-polymerases frequently bypass lesions without triggering repair. At multiple genomic scales, we show the pattern of DNA damage induced mutations is largely shaped by the influence of DNA accessibility on repair efficiency, rather than gradients of DNA damage. Finally, we reveal specific genomic conditions that can corrupt the fidelity of nucleotide excision repair and actively drive oncogenic mutagenesis. These results provide insight into how strand-asymmetric mechanisms underlie the formation, tolerance, and repair of DNA damage, thereby shaping cancer genome evolution.Competing Interest StatementP.F. is a member of the Scientific Advisory Boards of Fabric Genomics, Inc. and Eagle Genomics, Ltd.

abstract = {Author summary In settings such as bacterial infections and cancer, cellular populations grow exponentially. DNA mutations acquired during this growth can have profound effects, e.g. conferring drug resistance or faster tumour growth. In mathematical models of this fundamental process, considerable effort—spanning many decades—has been invested to understand the factors that control two key aspects of this process: how many cells exist with a set of mutations, and how long does it take for these cells to appear. In this paper, we consider these two aspects in a general mathematical framework. Surprisingly, for both quantities, we find universal probability distributions which are valid regardless of how many mutations we focus on, and what effect these mutations might have on the cells. The distributions are elegant and easy to work with, providing a computationally efficient alternative to intensive simulation-based approaches. We demonstrate the usefulness of our mathematical results by illustrating their consequences for bacterial experiments and cancer evolution.},
